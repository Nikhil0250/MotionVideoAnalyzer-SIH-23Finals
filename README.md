# MotionVideoAnalyzer-SIH-23Finals
I made this project as part of the SmartIndiaHackathon Finals'23
Problem statement: Development of motion amplification video techniques for vibration analysis It identifies moving features in video frames, amplifies and replays these motions, revealing micro-scale defects and enabling vibration analysis. MAV finds applications in assessing noise, vibrations, and shocks in diverse sectors.
Implemented motion amplification and frequency analysis of an object in a video as well as considering multiple objects using ROI technique and phase based techniques , with an accuracy rate of 88.9% and integrated all the
functionalities in an app using Tkinter.
Just download and keep all the files in a single folder and then run the FinalIntegratedApp file which will launch the file and proceed according to the functions given to upload your video and view the results...
